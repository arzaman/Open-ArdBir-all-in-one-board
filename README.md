# Open-ArdBir-all-in-one-board
Repository for HW design file (PCB, schematic)  of ArdBir all-in-one board

Open Ardbir is an open source SW (up to release 2.8.3) to control and automate beer brewing process
The SW have been developed based on Arduino UNO board (Atmega328 MCU) with few surroundings HW component to drive and interface external elements (PUMP, Heating element , LCD, push button etc.)

There are few open source HW board available supporting the SW either designed as  shield on top of Arduino Board, in this repository you can find all the CAD design file in order to build an "all-in-one" board that supports microcontroller Atmega328 (Arduino UNO) , all the surrounding componets (power, quartz, USB..) and the specific HW for interfacing brewing elements

The final result will be like this
